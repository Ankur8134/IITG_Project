Developed a robust and cost-effective home security solution leveraging IoT technology. Utilized an ESP32-CAM module, PIR motion sensor, BC547 transistor, resistors, and a 5V DC power supply to detect unauthorized activity and send real-time alerts via email or mobile application. Integrated hardware and software components to ensure reliable operation, low energy consumption, and user-friendly functionality.
The increasing need for home security in today's digital era has driven the demand for innovative and cost-effective solutions. Traditional security systems often require substantial installation costs and regular maintenance, making them less accessible to all users. The advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) offers a transformative approach to home security by enabling real-time monitoring, automation, and remote control. This project, titled IoT-Based Home Security System with Real-Time Alerts, presents a simple yet efficient solution that leverages IoT technology to enhance home safety. The system is designed to detect the motion, capture images, and send real-time alerts to the user’s device, enabling quick response to potential security threats. The system’s core components include the ESP32-CAM module, which integrates a microcontroller and a camera for image capture and processing. The PIR motion sensor module is employed to detect human motion within a defined range, while the BC547 NPN transistor and resistors (220 ohm, 1k, and 10k) are used to stabilize and amplify signals within the circuit. An LED indicator provides a visual cue for system activation, and a 5V DC power supply ensures reliable and energy-efficient operation. This project focuses on simplicity, scalability, and effectiveness, providing a solution that can be implemented by users with minimal technical expertise. By integrating these components into a cohesive system, the project aims to demonstrate how IoT technology can address modern home security challenges in a practical and accessible manner.
